# The process


## Opportunity
1. My skill in architecture, design, visualisation and 3d modelling accrued over a span of 6 years
2. My programming skills accrued over a span of 1 year
3. Existing renovation projects amounting to 20 projects 
4. Completed university, does not want to get into mainstream architecture. I want to join the programming world
   but broke at the same time and therefore wants to leverage on the skills learnt to win Gopillar projects. 
   At the same time, I want to continue learning python programming with dataflair
