# The process


## Opportunity
1. My skill in architecture, design, visualisation and 3d modelling accrued over a span of 6 years
2. My programming skills accrued over a span of 1 year
3. Existing renovation projects amounting to 20 projects 
4. Completed university, does not want to get into mainstream architecture. I want to join the programming world
   but broke at the same time and therefore wants to leverage on the skills learnt to win Gopillar projects. 
   At the same time, I want to continue learning python programming with dataflair
   


## Go_Pillar in summary

Projects are divided into the following categories according to type and size:
1. Apartment-Large, Medium, Small
2. House-Large, Medium, Small
3. Single room- Large, Medium, Small
4. Living /Sleeping area - Large, Medium, Small
5. Other - Large, Medium, Small
5. Restaurant - Large, Medium, Small
5. Garden - Large, Medium, Small


The most common projects done are Apartments and houses


## Parameters

Within Gopillar, there exists a repository of several projects with different interventions by different designers
The secret is to leverage on time and resources to complete one project.This will allow for time for exploration of 
several projects and thus increasing the probabilities of winning a several project.

The strategy aims at specialising on apartment small size because they bear a lot in similar. These are:
1. Layout options
2. Furniture options 
3. Finishes and furniture lists

Overtime, the strategy aims to expand to cover other scope sizes, from small, medium to large.

## procedure

1. The model of work is to optimize on BIM modelling.
2. Sketchup model + Revit Model + Autocad Models


Model the space in revit and basic furniture.

1.We are going to split the kind of furniture we are going to download from revit and sketchup
2.It would have been better if it was done in one  project such as revit but the quality of revit models is wanting.


## spatial resolution

### Tools
1.Revit

### Comprises 
1.Walls
2.Fenestration
2.CAD blocks
3.Ceiling design

### Outcome
1.Floor plan
2.Demolition plan
3.Wiring Plan
4.Lighting plan

The advantage is that this can be completely automated
1. Walls can be automated
2. Fenestration can be automated
3. Cad-blocks can be created, added, transformed and adjusted and repeated
4. Ceiling and lighting plans can be automated

THE BIGGER THE REVIT DATABASE, THE EASIER THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION



## Furniture , lighting & furnishing

NOTE:SPATIAL ADJUSTMENTS CAN ONLY MADE AT SPATIAL RESOLUTION ,NOTHING SHOULD BE ADJUSTED

### Tools
1. Sketchup-It has the highest number of furniture components
   
2. Import walls, fenestration and other parts in dwg format, import into sketchup 
comprises

### comprises
Furniture and lighting fixtures must be consistent with where they can be sourced
This makes it easier to create furniture list
leverage on BIM archiproducts
#### Furniture
1.Living room
2.Kitchen
3.Dining
4.Bedroom
5.Washroom

#### Furnishing
These are the most repetitive aspect of furnishing,They add flair to the design and do not need
much.
Borrow elements designed by other designers.
An indepth research on sketchup can yield high end furnishing

1.Living room-pillows,curtains,
2.Kitchen
3.Dining
4.Bedroom
5.Washroom
