The Automating Go-pillar is a command line interface algorithm, An algorithm that collects existing data on spatial 
configurations of apartments and curates it into instant design solutions. The intention is to shorten the design
decision-making process into milliseconds.


## The concept
There is a high probability that architectural problems, perception and trends amongst clients on how to modify their 
spaces is similar. This is further supported by the fact the societies tend to influence one another.

The only variation is the spatial constraints, structural walls, that delimits the client's already built habitable space.

The algorithm below intends to filter amongst the best proposed human habitations and fit the already existing solutions 
into new client's spaces. 

Little or no modification will be required of the spatial constraints.

## Opportunity
Every single day, the world gives birth to clients in need of renovation,re-imagination and re-invention of their
habitation. Little do they now that the solutions they are looking for is out there scattered amongst the vast fields 
of the internet.

## Go_Pillar in Summary

Projects are divided into the following categories according to type and size:
1. Apartment-Large, Medium, Small
2. House-Large, Medium, Small
3. Single room- Large, Medium, Small
4. Living /Sleeping area - Large, Medium, Small
5. Other - Large, Medium, Small
5. Restaurant - Large, Medium, Small
5. Garden - Large, Medium, Small


The programme above intends to specialise on spaces already delimited by structural-walls
thus controlled outcomes ar expected.

## Project Categories
There are a few categories the algorithm will specialise with. 
These are:
1. Apartment-Small
2. Single room-Small
3. Single room-Medium
4. Single room-Large
5. Living Sleeping area-Small
6. Living Sleeping area-Medium

The rate of completion of small-scale project is high. Thus increased probabilities of 
wining these projects.

## Project Attributes

Design being an art, this parameter picks the unique aspects of the project as per the users'
perception. This makes it easier to pin-point later.


## Curating the best solutions

The algorithm handpicks the best submission made per project and
records the spaces proposed by the designer.The assumption is that, this the best 
representation of the clients needs at that point and time.


## The predictable clients needs

When a new client submits a design problem, the following information will be analyzed :
1. The existing layout of the building 
2. The clients brief 
   
A physical analysis of the above returns the client's spatial requirements .

## Feeding the Chief architect
The client's spatial requirements documented above are then fed into the algorithm, 
which in turn returns all the best entry options that match the clients needs.

## Adjusting the delimiting constraints
1. Adjusting of the spatial constraints in order to generate a new floor plan
2. The same renders are re-entered as a submission requirement alongside demolition plans,
   furniture and lighting plans.
   

   
 As a result , ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT ARCHITECTS is born.
 
## Future updates

1. A section of abstracted clients requirements will be desirable.-Look for keywords that are likely
   to capture the clients desired outcome.
